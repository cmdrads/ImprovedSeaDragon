# Stock Scale Sea Dragon

This mod is intended to be a version of Sea Dragon that can work with stock scale parts and stock scale systems. It is incredibly overpowered in the stock system so I highly recommend that you either install Rescale 2.5x, or even better, KSRSS Reborn, as these mods increase the size of the system to 2.5x (a quarter of real life) the size of the stock system.
